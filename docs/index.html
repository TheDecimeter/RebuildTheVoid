  Welcome, thanks for trying out my game. If you can, please record yourself playing and verbally state
  every action you are hoping to do.
  Seeing how many times you try something, helps me know how to progress.
  <br><br>
  If you don't know how to record your screen, and you are going to the University of Utah:
  <ul>
	  <li>Go to <a href="https://utah.zoom.us/">https://utah.zoom.us/</a></li>
	  <li>Click <q>Sign in</q>.
		  <ul>
			<li>(you can sign in the same way you get into CIS)</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Click <q>Host a meeting</q> in the upper right.
		  <ul>
			<li>(you'll have to click a drop down option)</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>You will be promted to open Zoom, do that.</li>
	  <li>Click the record button at the bottom.
		  <ul>
			<li>(Cloud recording should be the most convenient option, just DM me the link and password on discord)</li>
			<li>If you want audio, make sure the mic input is correct. Zoom sometimes changes this if you are hosting rather than joining (it also might be using a different account than expected).</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
  </ul>

	<b>If you are having trouble playing,</b><br>
	make note of what part of the game was difficult/confusing (what you are trying to do to succeed at playing). 
	<br>Then, watch the video below for tips.<br>
	<br> Remember this is a one button game. The button is held anytime the white <q>grapple</q> is used.<br>
